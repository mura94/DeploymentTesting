# DeploymentTesting

A temporary test repository for debugging OFB upload & deployment issues.

This repository is meant to suppliment [this document](https://gist.github.com/mura94/a188260377915f9311ff9292c0a89699). This repository contains the Unity project file that has been used to create a minimal, bare-bones Quest application to test the upload & deployment procedure through the Oculus business channels.

**This repository will be deleted in the near future.**

This project requires Unity 2019.4.28f1 (LTS)
